# 📌 Project Title

> ### **End-to-End Medical AI Inference and Web Serving**



<br><br>
## 📖 Overview

With the rapid aging of the population, the demand for medical services continues to increase, leading to a growing shortage of medical professionals. <br> 
To address this challenge, AI-driven medical devices and intelligent healthcare systems are being actively developed to support clinical decision-making and improve efficiency.<br>
In this project, I developed a web-based application that leverages both computer vision and large language models (LLMs) to assist medical professionals in the diagnostic process.<br> 
The system aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce the workload of clinicians, and demonstrate how AI models can be effectively deployed and served in a real-world medical environment.

## 🧩 Data Preprocessing
- **Dataset**: 10,000 Pediatric Abdominal X-ray Composite Images (Pyloric Stenosis, Pneumoperitoneum, )
- **Method**: Applied on-the-fly data augmentation using Albumentations, including geometric transformations (shift, rotation), photometric variations (brightness/contrast), and elastic deformation to improve model robustness and generalization.

## 🤖 Model Training
- ### **Vision**
  - **Pediatric Abdominal X-ray Diagnosis**
    - Based on the U-Net original paper, I trained a model with BatchNorm and Padding added for training stability and segmentation performance
    - 
- **Approach**:
  - Trained an **AutoEncoder** on large volumes of data sequences generated by the `Sliding Window` method.
  - The model trains to reconstruct normal remote meter reading patterns.
- **Loss Function Improvement**:
  - Base loss: `MSELoss`
  - Added penalty when the **difference in consecutive values** is smaller than a set `threshold`  
    → Helps detect **nearly constant values** in usage patterns, which may indicate solitary death events.
  - `Threshold` is not fixed, as it depends on the distribution of the dataset.
